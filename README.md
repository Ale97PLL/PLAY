PLAY is the software for Windows 10/11 and EAGLE computers that PrimaLuceLab developed in order to provide the easiest solution for astrophotography with telescope, camera and other accessories you want to use in your setup. PLAY is not a replacement for great automation astrophotography softwares like Sequence Generator Pro, NINA, Voyager, MaximDL, Prism and others that provide the most advanced features but that are designed for experts. PLAY is the straightforward way for advanced astrophotography allowing you to record great pictures of galaxies, nebulas, star clusters, planets, Moon and Sun without complexity!

## As an industry first, automated deep-sky astrophotography with Alt-Az mounts and ARCO rotator.

Not only PLAY allows you to control EQ mounts through their ASCOM driver but it also automates Alt-Az deep-sky astrophotography by taking control of selected Alt-Az mounts (actually tested with SkyWatcher AZ-EQ5 and AZ-EQ6) and using ARCO rotator as high resolution field de-rotator! This opens new possibilities in deep-sky objects astrophotography since an Alt-Az mount doesn’t require polar alignment, is not limited by the meridian flip and allows to install multiple parallel telescopes and removing counterweights!

## Astronomy camera control to preview image and capture a sequence.

Not only PLAY allows you to connect to PrimaLuceLab devices, but you can also control astronomy cameras provided with ASCOM drivers (compatible with ASCOM platform at least 6.5 version). This way you can decide your acquisition settings, preview the image, stretch the histogram and capture a sequence of images that you can later stack with a dedicated astrophotography processing software.
