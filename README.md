![Play Pc](https://www.primalucelab.com/9467-thickbox_default/play-prima-luce-astrophotography-software.jpg)

PLAY is the astrophotography software that allows you to record beautiful pictures of the night sky in the simplest way, with the telescope, mount and camera you prefer! Connect all your telescope devices to PLAY and start your exploration of the Universe: check the Planetarium sky chart to find astrophotography targets, visualise your field of view, and automatically point to the target you select (also with Auto Alignment); focus your image (also with AutoFocus) and rotate your camera sensor; capture Dark, Flat, and Bias calibration files to optimise your image processing; control your camera to preview images or to record a sequence (also with AutoStacking).

PLAY allows you to configurate your telescope by selecting OTA, EQ or Alt-Az mount provided with ASCOM drivers, astronomy camera and filter wheels provided with ASCOM drivers, ESATTO focuser or SESTO SENSO 2 focusing motor, ARCO rotator, GIOTTO flat field generator, ALTO telescope cover motor and ScopeDome observatory domes!

In order to use PLAY you have to have at least ESATTO focuser, SESTO SENSO 2 focusing motor, GIOTTO flat field generator or ALTO telescope cover motor. PLAY is free and you can can download it from the [DOWNLOAD](https://www.primalucelab.com/info/downloads.html) section of our website!

## Discover PLAY, the Prima Luce AstrophotographY software.

PLAY is the software for Windows 10/11 and EAGLE computers that PrimaLuceLab developed in order to provide the easiest solution for astrophotography with telescope, camera and other accessories you want to use in your setup. PLAY is not a replacement for great automation astrophotography softwares like Sequence Generator Pro, NINA, Voyager, MaximDL, Prism and others that provide the most advanced features but that are designed for experts. PLAY is the straightforward way for advanced astrophotography allowing you to record great pictures of galaxies, nebulas, star clusters, planets, and Moon without complexity!

## The all-in-one and easy to use platform for your astrophotography

Instead of requiring you to use many different softwares to control all your devices or a complicated software to make it all work together, PLAY offers an easy to use interface that simplify the capture process of astrophotography images. PLAY offers many features like focus control, mount alignment and goto, target preview, camera rotation, and much more!

## As an industry first, automated deep-sky astrophotography with Alt-Az mounts and ARCO rotator

Not only PLAY allows you to control EQ mounts through their ASCOM driver but it also automates Alt-Az deep-sky astrophotography by taking control of selected Alt-Az mounts (tested with SkyWatcher AZ-EQ5/AZ-EQ6 and Track The Stars TTS-160 Panther) and using ARCO rotator as high resolution field de-rotator! This opens new possibilities in deep-sky objects astrophotography since an Alt-Az mount doesn’t require polar alignment, is not limited by the meridian flip and allows to install multiple parallel telescopes and removing counterweights!

## Planetarium sky chart to easily control mount position, find targets and check Field of View

The Planetarium draws night sky charts to let you easily identify stars, planets, constellations, and deep-sky objects and easily point the telescope at them. If you also connected a camera to PLAY, Planetarium plots the field of view (FoV) on the sky chart based on your telescope’s focal length and camera specifications to help you easily check if your desired target can be fully framed. And, if you don’t know the objects that are present on the sky chart, the Suggested Targets feature will show you the objects you could take a picture of, with a preview image by famous astrophotographers!

## Astronomy camera control to preview image and capture a sequence

Not only PLAY allows you to connect to PrimaLuceLab devices, but you can also control astronomy cameras provided with ASCOM drivers (compatible with cameras provided with ASCOM driver updated for ASCOM platform 6.6). This way you can decide your acquisition settings, preview the image, stretch the histogram and capture a sequence of images that you can later stack with a dedicated astrophotography processing software.

## Take control of your preferred telescope and accessories for astrophotography

PLAY allows you to configurate your telescope by selecting OTA and mount type by connecting to ASCOM drivers (tested with ASCOM platform 6.6). In order to use PLAY you have to have at least an ESATTO focuser, a SESTO SENSO 2 focusing motor, a GIOTTO flat field generator or an ALTO telescope cover motor and it natively supports ARCO rotator!

## AutoFocus to automatically focus your images

PLAY moves the telescope's focuser with a precise step number and, at each step, it captures an image and analyzes sharpness of the stars. As the focuser moves from a position out of focus towards the point of optimal focus, the measured sharpness improves, reaches its peak, and then begins to worsen again as the focuser moves past the point of optimal focus. Plotting the sharpness metric against the focuser position creates a graph that ideally looks like a "V". PLAY automatically detects the bottom of the "V" that indicates the position of optimal focus and automatically moves the focuser to the optimal focus position.

## Auto Alignment to automatically align your telescope
“Auto Alignment” allows you to automatically align your telescope to the sky by finding coordinates of your image center with arcsecond accuracy. This way you can precisely point your telescope to your desired target, even if difficult to detect with short exposure times. This feature make use of ASTAP software (ASTAP is free, https://www.hnsky.org/astap.htm by Han Kleijn) to analyse pictures captured by PLAY and detect alignment stars.

## AutoStacking to automatically stack images during a sequence acquisition

Stacking in astrophotography improves the quality of images by combining multiple images of the same object into a single, final image. When you launch a sequence acquisition with several images of the same object, because of the Earth's rotation and slight variations in positioning due to normal tracking errors of mount, each image might not be perfectly aligned with the others. In order to correct this, PLAY is able to automatically align every image with the previous one. Then it combines the captures to produce a single image with improved visibility of the object and reduced noise. This way you have a pre-processed image during your sequence acquisition and you will also have the FITS files available for later processing.

## Dual-telescope mode: simultaneously control 2 telescopes.

PLAY allows you to control also setups composed by 2 telescopes on a single mount: now you can control 2 optical tubes (OTA1 and OTA2) that have dual focusers, dual rotators, dual flat field generators and dual telescope cover motors! Also the "Connect All" feature allows you to connect to dual telescope setups with just a click of a button.

## Multi-language support: English, Italian, German, Spanish, French and Japanese.
PLAY is available in different languages so it's even easier to use. With a simple selector you can select different languages: English, Italian, German, Spanish, French and Japanese. We're also working to add new languages and, if you want to help us to translate in another language, please write us to support@primalucelab.com.
